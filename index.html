    <h1 id="red">Daffodils</h1>
    <p id="class">by William Wordsworth </p>
  <p id="green">
    I wandered lonely as a Cloud <br>
    That floats on high o'er vales and Hills, <br>
    When all at once I saw a crowd,<br> A host, of golden daffodils; <br> Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br> Fluttering and
    dancing in the breeze . <br>
    </p>
    
<p id="blue">
 Continuous as the stars that shine <br> 
 And twinkle on the milky way, <br>
They stretched in never-ending line  <br>
Along the margin of a bay: <br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance, <br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. <br>
</p>

<p id="pink">
  The waves beside them danced;  but they  <br> 
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:  <br>
A poet could not but be gay, <br>
In such a jocund company: <br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought <br>
What wealth the show to me had brought: <br>
</p>

<p id="yellow">
For oft, when on my couch I lie <br> 
In vacant or in pensive mood, <br>
They flash upon that inward eye <br>
Which is the bliss of solitude; <br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills, <br>
And dances with the daffodils. <br>
</p>
